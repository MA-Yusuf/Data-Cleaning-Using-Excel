PROBLEM STATEMENT
---
With over 99,000 rows of raw data, Pulse-360 Advertising marketing campaign performance dataset includes various performance metrics for campaigns acrossa vast audience spectrum. However, the dataset contains inconsistencies, missing values, duplicates, and data formatting issues, which hinder accurate analysis. These problems could lead to misleading insights, impact the firm's decision-making process, and limit its ability to optimize future campaigns. Therefore, cleaning and preprocessing the data is essential to prepare it for a detailed analysis.

AIM OF THE PROJECT
---
* Conduct comprehensive data cleaning to make the marketing campaign performance dataset ready for analysis.
* Identify and address missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies within the dataset.
* Standardize data formats across all columns to ensure uniformity.
* Correct erroneous entries and inconsistencies in categorical field
* Enhance data reliability to support accurate and meaningful insights into the campaign performance.

MODELLING
---
I conducted comprehensive data cleaning by using filter functions to eliminate null values and ensuring proper formatting of each column (e.g., Date, Text, Number) to support accurate analysis. The data model consists of a main table, which includes fields such as (Campaign Type, Campaign ID, Company, Target Audience, Durations, Channels Used, Conversion Rate, Acquisition Cost, ROI, Impressions, Location, and Customer Segment). By cleaning this table, we can conduct comprehensive analysis to better understand the marketing campaign dataset at business level.

DATA ANALYSIS
---
The analysis on this cleaned dataset presents that majority of the campaign type came from 'search' with a total of '19931' while the least came from 'None' with a total of '15'. Majority of gender searches came from 'Men' with a total of '39796' while the least came from both 'Men & Women' with a total of '19963' at Pulse 360 Advertising. 

RECOMMENDATIONS
---
Here are some recommendations to help stakeholders at Pulse 360 Advertising to improve marketing campaign performance in the coming year based on the insights drawn from the dataset
* Although majority of campaign type came from searches, Pulse 360 should improve their social media appearance.
* Pulse 360 could also partner with influencers to help boost their social media appearance. 

These recommendations aim to enhance marketing campaign performance by focusing on more channels engagement strategies for the upcoming year.
